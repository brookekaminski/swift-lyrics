                length: '3:30',
                lyrics: `I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
                Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
                I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
                
                I hit the ground running each night
                I hit the Sunday matinee
                You know the greatest films of all time were never made
                
                I guess you never know, never know
                And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
                And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
                And it's alright now
                
                But we were something, don't you think so?
                Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
                And if my wishes came true
                It would've been you
                In my defense, I have none
                For never leaving well enough alone
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one
                
                I have this dream you're doing cool shit
                Having adventures on your own
                You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
                We never painted by the numbers, baby
                But we were making it count
                You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
                
                I guess you never know, never know
                And it's another day, waking up alone
                
                But we were something, don't you think so?
                Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
                And if my wishes came true
                It would've been you
                In my defense, I have none
                For never leaving well enough alone
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one
                
                Hey, yeah-yeah
                I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
                If one thing had been different
                Would everything be different today?
                
                We were something, don't you think so?
                Rosé flowing with your chosen family
                And it would've been sweet
                If it could've been me
                In my defense, I have none
                For digging up the grave another time
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one`

                lyrics: `Vintage tee, brand new phone
                High heels on cobblestones
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                Sequin smile, black lipstick
                Sensual politics
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you
                Dancing in your Levi's
                Drunk under a streetlight, I
                I knew you
                Hand under my sweatshirt
                Baby kiss it better, right
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                A friend to all is a friend to none
                Chase two girls, lose the one
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you
                Playing hide-and-seek and
                Giving me your weekends
                I, I knew you
                Your heartbeat on the High Line
                Once in twenty lifetimes, I
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                
                To kiss in cars and downtown bars
                Was all we needed
                You drew stars around my scars
                But now I'm bleeding
                
                'Cause I knew you
                Stepping on the last train
                Marked me like a bloodstain, I
                I knew you
                Tried to change the ending
                Peter losing Wendy
                I, I knew you
                Leaving like a father
                Running like water, I
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
                I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
                The smell of smoke would hang around this long
                'Cause I knew everything when I was young
                I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
                Chasing shadows in the grocery line
                I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
                And you'd be standing in my front porch light
                And I knew you'd come back to me
                You'd come back to me
                And you'd come back to me
                And you'd come back
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite`
