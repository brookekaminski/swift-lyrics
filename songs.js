                length: '3:30',
                lyrics: `I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
                Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
                I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
                
                I hit the ground running each night
                I hit the Sunday matinee
                You know the greatest films of all time were never made
                
                I guess you never know, never know
                And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
                And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
                And it's alright now
                
                But we were something, don't you think so?
                Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
                And if my wishes came true
                It would've been you
                In my defense, I have none
                For never leaving well enough alone
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one
                
                I have this dream you're doing cool shit
                Having adventures on your own
                You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
                We never painted by the numbers, baby
                But we were making it count
                You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
                
                I guess you never know, never know
                And it's another day, waking up alone
                
                But we were something, don't you think so?
                Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
                And if my wishes came true
                It would've been you
                In my defense, I have none
                For never leaving well enough alone
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one
                
                Hey, yeah-yeah
                I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
                If one thing had been different
                Would everything be different today?
                
                We were something, don't you think so?
                Rosé flowing with your chosen family
                And it would've been sweet
                If it could've been me
                In my defense, I have none
                For digging up the grave another time
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one`

                lyrics: `Vintage tee, brand new phone
                High heels on cobblestones
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                Sequin smile, black lipstick
                Sensual politics
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you
                Dancing in your Levi's
                Drunk under a streetlight, I
                I knew you
                Hand under my sweatshirt
                Baby kiss it better, right
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                A friend to all is a friend to none
                Chase two girls, lose the one
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you
                Playing hide-and-seek and
                Giving me your weekends
                I, I knew you
                Your heartbeat on the High Line
                Once in twenty lifetimes, I
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                
                To kiss in cars and downtown bars
                Was all we needed
                You drew stars around my scars
                But now I'm bleeding
                
                'Cause I knew you
                Stepping on the last train
                Marked me like a bloodstain, I
                I knew you
                Tried to change the ending
                Peter losing Wendy
                I, I knew you
                Leaving like a father
                Running like water, I
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
                I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
                The smell of smoke would hang around this long
                'Cause I knew everything when I was young
                I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
                Chasing shadows in the grocery line
                I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
                And you'd be standing in my front porch light
                And I knew you'd come back to me
                You'd come back to me
                And you'd come back to me
                And you'd come back
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite`

                length: '3:59',
                lyrics: `Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train
                It was sunny
                Her saltbox house on the coast
                Took her mind off St. Louis
                Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
                And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
                The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
                There's only so far new money goes
                They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
                Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
                The doctor had told him to settle down
                It must have been her fault his heart gave out
                And they said
                "There goes the last great American dynasty"
                "Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been"
                "There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen"
                "She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything"
                Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set
                Forever
                Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
                Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
                And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
                And losin' on card game bets with Dalí
                And they said
                "There goes the last great American dynasty"
                "Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been"
                "There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen"
                "She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything"
                They say she was seen on occasion
                Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
                And in a feud with her neighbour
                She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
                50 years is a long time
                Holiday house sat quietly on that beach
                Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
                And then it was bought by me
                Who knows if I never showed up what could've been
                There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
                I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything
                I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything
                A marvelous time ruinin' everything
                A marvelous time
                I had a marvelous time`

                lyrics: `I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
                Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
                And if it was an open-shut case
                I never would've known from that look on your face
                Lost in your current like a priceless wine
                The more that you say
                The less I know
                Wherever you stray
                I follow
                I'm begging for you to take my hand
                Wreck my plans
                That's my man
                Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
                Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
                As if you were a mythical thing
                Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
                And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
                The more that you say

                Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
                They count me out time and time again
                Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
                But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
                Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
                Show me the places where the others gave you scars
                Now this is an open-shut case
                Guess I should've known from the look on your face
                Every bait and switch was a work of art

                So you could sit there in this hurt
                Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
                You're not sure which is worse
                Because I dropped your hand while dancing
                Left you out there standing
                Crestfallen on the landing
                Champagne problems
                Your mom's ring in your pocket

                You told your family for a reason
                You couldn't keep it in
                Your sister splashed out on the bottle
                Now no one's celebrating
                Dom Pérignon, you brought it
                No crowd of friends applauded
                Your hometown skeptics called it
                Champagne problems
                You had a speech, you're speechless
                Love slipped beyond your reaches
                And I couldn't give a reason
                Champagne problems
                Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
                November flush and your flannel cure
                "This dorm was once a madhouse"
                I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
                How evergreen, our group of friends
                Don't think we'll say that word again
                And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
                That we once walked through
                One for the money, two for the show
                I never was ready, so I watch you go
                Sometimes you just don't know the answer
                'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
                "She would've made such a lovely bride
                What a shame she's fucked in her head, " they said
                But you'll find the real thing instead
                She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
                And hold your hand while dancing
                Never leave you standing
                Crestfallen on the landing
                With champagne problems
                Your mom's ring in your pocket
                Her picture in your wallet
                You won't remember all my
                Champagne problems
                You won't remember all my
