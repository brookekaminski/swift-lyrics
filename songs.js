                length: '3:30',
                lyrics: `I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
                Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
                I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
                
                I hit the ground running each night
                I hit the Sunday matinee
                You know the greatest films of all time were never made
                
                I guess you never know, never know
                And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
                And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
                And it's alright now
                
                But we were something, don't you think so?
                Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
                And if my wishes came true
                It would've been you
                In my defense, I have none
                For never leaving well enough alone
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one
                
                I have this dream you're doing cool shit
                Having adventures on your own
                You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
                We never painted by the numbers, baby
                But we were making it count
                You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
                
                I guess you never know, never know
                And it's another day, waking up alone
                
                But we were something, don't you think so?
                Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
                And if my wishes came true
                It would've been you
                In my defense, I have none
                For never leaving well enough alone
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one
                
                Hey, yeah-yeah
                I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
                If one thing had been different
                Would everything be different today?
                
                We were something, don't you think so?
                Rosé flowing with your chosen family
                And it would've been sweet
                If it could've been me
                In my defense, I have none
                For digging up the grave another time
                But it would've been fun
                If you would've been the one`

                lyrics: `Vintage tee, brand new phone
                High heels on cobblestones
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                Sequin smile, black lipstick
                Sensual politics
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you
                Dancing in your Levi's
                Drunk under a streetlight, I
                I knew you
                Hand under my sweatshirt
                Baby kiss it better, right
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                A friend to all is a friend to none
                Chase two girls, lose the one
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you
                Playing hide-and-seek and
                Giving me your weekends
                I, I knew you
                Your heartbeat on the High Line
                Once in twenty lifetimes, I
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite
                
                To kiss in cars and downtown bars
                Was all we needed
                You drew stars around my scars
                But now I'm bleeding
                
                'Cause I knew you
                Stepping on the last train
                Marked me like a bloodstain, I
                I knew you
                Tried to change the ending
                Peter losing Wendy
                I, I knew you
                Leaving like a father
                Running like water, I
                When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                
                But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
                I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
                The smell of smoke would hang around this long
                'Cause I knew everything when I was young
                I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
                Chasing shadows in the grocery line
                I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
                And you'd be standing in my front porch light
                And I knew you'd come back to me
                You'd come back to me
                And you'd come back to me
                And you'd come back
                
                And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
                You put me on and said I was your favorite`

                length: '3:51',
                lyrics: `Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train
                It was sunny
                Her saltbox house on the coast
                Took her mind off St. Louis
                Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
                And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
                The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
                There's only so far new money goes
                They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
                Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
                The doctor had told him to settle down
                It must have been her fault his heart gave out
                And they said
                "There goes the last great American dynasty"
                "Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been"
                "There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen"
                "She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything"
                Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set
                Forever
                Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
                Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
                And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
                And losin' on card game bets with Dalí
                And they said
                "There goes the last great American dynasty"
                "Who knows if she never showed up, what could've been"
                "There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen"
                "She had a marvelous time ruinin' everything"
                They say she was seen on occasion
                Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
                And in a feud with her neighbour
                She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
                50 years is a long time
                Holiday house sat quietly on that beach
                Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
                And then it was bought by me
                Who knows if I never showed up what could've been
                There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
                I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything
                I had a marvelous time ruinin' everything
                A marvelous time ruinin' everything
                A marvelous time
                I had a marvelous time`

                With his arms around your body
                Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
                And it took you five whole minutes
                To pack us up and leave me with it
                Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
                I think I've seen this film before
                And I didn't like the ending
                You're not my homeland anymore

                You were my town

                Like he's just your understudy
                Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
                Second, third, and hundredth chances
                Balancin' on breaking branches
                Those eyes add insult to injury

                So step right out, there is no amount
                Of crying I can do for you
                All this time

                You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)

                Weepin' in a sunlit room, and
                If I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes too
                Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe

                Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
                Look at how my tears ricochet
                We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
                Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
                You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
                But what a ghostly scene
                You wear the same jewels that I gave you
                As you bury me
                I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
                'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
                And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
                Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
                Look at how my tears ricochet
                And I can go anywhere I want
                Anywhere I want, just not home
                And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
                But you would still miss me in your bones
                And I still talk to you (when I'm screaming at the sky)
                And when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)
                I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
                And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
                You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
                Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
                You turned into your worst fears
                And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
                Crossing out the good years
                And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
                Look at how my tears ricochet`

                In the trees
                I hit my peak at seven feet
                In the swing
                Over the creek
                I was too scared to jump in
                But I, I was high in the sky
                With Pennsylvania under me
                Are there still beautiful things?
                Sweet tea in the summer
                Cross your heart, won't tell no other
                And though I can't recall your face
                I still got love for you
                Your braids like a pattern
                Love you to the moon and to Saturn
                Passed down like folk songs
                The love lasts so long
                And I've been meaning to tell you
                I think your house is haunted
                Your dad is always mad and that must be why
                And I think you should come live with
                Me and we can be pirates
                Then you won't have to cry
                Or hide in the closet
                And just like a folk song
                Our love will be passed on
                Please picture me
                In the weeds
                Before I learned civility
                I used to scream ferociously
                Any time I wanted
                I, I
                Sweet tea in the summer
                Cross my heart, won't tell no other
                And though I can't recall your face
                I still got love for you
                Pack your dolls and a sweater
                We'll move to India forever
                Passed down like folk songs
                Our love lasts so long`

                Cancel plans just in case you'd call
                And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
                So much for summer love and saying "us"
                'Cause you weren't mine to lose
                You weren't mine to lose, no
                But I can see us lost in the memory

                I have a lot of regrets about that
                Pulled the car off the road to the lookout

                I have a lot of regrets about that
                I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
                Fell behind on my classmates, and I ended up here
                Pouring out my heart to a stranger

                It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
                You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

                Hood over your head, keep your eyes down

                A million little times
                Leave the perfume on the shelf

                Take the words for what they are
                A dwindling, mercurial high
                A drug that only worked

                A million little times

                Don't call me "kid"
                Don't call me "baby"

                You made her like that
                And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
                And you find something to wrap your noose around
                And there's nothin' like a mad woman
                I'm takin' my time
                Takin' my time
                'Cause you took everything from me
                Watchin' you climb
                Watchin' you climb
                Over people like me
                The master of spin
                Has a couple side flings
                Good wives always know
                She should be mad
                Should be scathing like me
                But no one likes a mad woman
                What a shame she went mad
                You made her like that`

                When I passed your house
                It's like I couldn't breathe
                You heard the rumors from Inez

                In the garden would you trust me
                If I told you it was just a summer thing?

                Betty, I know where it all went wrong
                Your favorite song was playing
                From the far side of the gym
                I was nowhere to be found
                I hate the crowds, you know that

                Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
                A figment of my worst intentions
                She said "James, get in, let's drive"
                Those days turned into nights
                Slept next to her, but
                I dreamt of you all summer long
                Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
                And I planned it out for weeks now
                But it's finally sinkin' in
                Betty, right now is the last time
                I can dream about what happens when
                You see my face again
                The only thing I wanna do
                Is make it up to you
                So I showed up at your party
                Yeah, I showed up at your party
                Yeah, I showed up at your party
                Will you have me?
                Will you love me?
                Will you kiss me on the porch
                In front of all your stupid friends?
                If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
                Will it patch your broken wings?
                I'm only 17, I don't know anything
                But I know I miss you
                Standing in your cardigan
                Kissin' in my car again
                Stopped at a streetlight

                I talk shit with my friends
                It's like I'm wasting your honor
                And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
                Sit with you in the trenches
                Give you my wild, give you a child
                Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
                Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
                Is it enough?
                But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
                I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
                But the rain is always gonna come if you're standing with me

                My picture in your wallet
                Your heart was glass, I dropped it
                Champagne problems
                You told your family for a reason
                You couldn't keep it in
                Your sister splashed out on the bottle
                Now no one's celebrating
                Dom Pérignon, you brought it
                No crowd of friends applauded
                Your hometown skeptics called it
                Champagne problems
                You had a speech, you're speechless
                Love slipped beyond your reaches
                And I couldn't give a reason
                Champagne problems
                Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
                November flush and your flannel cure
                "This dorm was once a madhouse"
                I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
                How evergreen, our group of friends
                Don't think we'll say that word again
                And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
                That we once walked through
                One for the money, two for the show
                I never was ready, so I watch you go
                Sometimes you just don't know the answer
                'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
                "She would've made such a lovely bride
                What a shame she's fucked in her head, " they said
                But you'll find the real thing instead
                She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
                And hold your hand while dancing
                Never leave you standing
                Crestfallen on the landing
                With champagne problems
                Your mom's ring in your pocket
                Her picture in your wallet
                You won't remember all my
                Champagne problems
                You won't remember all my

                Do you ever stop and think about me?
                When we were younger
                Down in the park
                Honey, making a lark of the misery
                You got shiny friends since you left town
                A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
                And I got nothing but well wishes for ya
                Ooh
                This place is the same as it ever was
                Ooh
                But you don't like it that way
                It's never too late
                To come back to my side
                The stars in your eyes
                Shined brighter in Tupelo
                And if you're ever tired of being known
                For who you know
                You know, you'll always know me
                Dorothea (ah-ah)
                Dorothea (ah-ah)
                Ooh, you're a queen
                Selling dreams
                Selling make up and magazines
                Ooh, from you I'd buy anything
                Hey Dorothea
                Do you ever stop and think about me?
                When it was calmer
                Skipping the prom
                Just to piss off your mom
                And her pageant schemes
                And damn, Dorothea
                They all wanna be ya
                But are you still the same soul
                I met under the bleachers?
                Well
                Ooh
                I guess I'll never know
                Ooh
                And you'll go on with the show
                But it's never too late

                What's a lifetime of achievement
                If I pushed you to the edge
                But you were too polite to leave me?
                Do you miss the rogue
                Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
                Will you forgive my soul
                When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
                'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
                It was the one place to be
                The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
                Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
                Over and over

                When the sun goes down
                Were you waiting at our old spot
                In the tree line, by the gold clock?
                Did I leave you hanging every single day?
                Were you standing in the hallway with a big cake?
                Happy birthday
                Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?
                A universe away
                And when I got into the accident
                The sight that flashed before me was your face
                But when I walked up to the podium
                I think that I forgot to say your name
                I'm on a bench in Coney Island
                Wondering, "Where did my baby go?"

                Crescent moon, coast is clear

                What died didn't stay dead
                You're alive, you're alive in my head
                What died didn't stay dead
                What died didn't stay dead
                You're alive, so alive
                Never be so polite, you forget your power
                Never wield such power, you forget to be polite
                And if I didn't know better
                I'd think you were listening to me now
                If I didn't know better

                You're alive, you're alive in my head
                What died didn't stay dead
                What died didn't stay dead
                You're alive, so alive
                The autumn chill that wakes me up
                You loved the amber skies so much
                Long limbs and frozen swims
                You'd always go past where our feet could touch
                And I complained the whole way there
                The car ride back and up the stairs
                I should've asked you questions
                I should've asked you how to be
                Asked you to write it down for me
                Should've kept every grocery store receipt
                'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
                Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
                All your closets of backlogged dreams
                And how you left them all to me
                What died didn't stay dead
                What died didn't stay dead
                You're alive, you're alive in my head
                What died didn't stay dead
                What died didn't stay dead
                You're alive, so alive
                And if I didn't know better
                I'd think you were singing to me now
                If I didn't know better
                I'd think you were still around
                I know better
                But I still feel you all around
                I know better

                I've been down since July
                Motion capture
                Put me in a bad light
                I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
                Trying to find the one where I went wrong
                Writing letters
                Addressed to the fire
                And I was catching my breath
                Staring out an open window
                Catching my death
                And I couldn't be sure
                I had a feeling so peculiar
                That this pain would be for
                Evermore
                Hey December
                Guess I'm feeling unmoored
                Can't remember
                What I used to fight for
                I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
                On the very moment all was lost
                Sending signals
                To be double crossed
                And I was catching my breath
                Barefoot in the wildest winter
                Catching my death
                And I couldn't be sure
                I had a feeling so peculiar
                That this pain would be for
                Evermore
                (Evermore)
                Can't not think of all the cost
                And the things that will be lost
                Oh, can we just get a pause?
                To be certain we'll be tall again
                Whether weather be the frost
                Or the violence of the dog days
                I'm on waves, out being tossed
                Is there a line that I could just go cross?
                And when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost)
                I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)
                In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)
                I dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)
                (If you think of all the costs)
                It was real enough (whether weather be the frost)
                To get me through (or the violence of the dog days)
                (Out on waves being tossed)
                But I swear (is there a line that we could just go cross?)
                You were there
                And I was catching my breath
                Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
                And I couldn't be sure
                I had a feeling so peculiar
                This pain wouldn't be for
                Evermore
                Evermore (evermore)
                Evermore
                This pain wouldn't be for evermore (evermore)

                They expected me to find somewhere
                Some perspective, but I sat and stared

                Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
                She's still 23 inside her fantasy
                How it was supposed to be
                Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
                Break-ups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
                She's still 23 inside her fantasy
                And you're sitting in front of me

                Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
                I'm sure that you got a wife out there
                Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
